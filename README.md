## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/)
- [IP Geolocation API](https://freegeoip.app/) - The location is not accurate in Thailand.
- [quote API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)
- [Framer Motion animation](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Easy to use

### What I learned

This is the project that I think a lot about the performance, which is the thing that I always ignored before. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/usememo-and-usecallback/) - This article explains `useMemo` and `useCalback`. The example in this article is very similar to the challenge.
